# ðŸ”— SQL Joins: Multiple Tables and Conditions

In SQL, a JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column â€” usually a foreign key. This is super useful when data is split across different tables.

For example:
You might have a `customers` table and a `customer_orders table`.
You want to see which customer made which order â€” thatâ€™s where joins come in!

## ðŸ§© Basic JOIN Types
| Join Type         | What It Does                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INNER JOIN`      | Only shows rows where thereâ€™s a match in **both** tables                |
| `LEFT JOIN`       | Shows **all rows from the left** table, and matched rows from the right |
| `RIGHT JOIN`      | Shows **all rows from the right** table, and matched rows from the left |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | Shows **all rows from both** tables, with `NULL` where thereâ€™s no match |

## ðŸ§ª Table Setup Example
customer
| customer\_id | first\_name |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| 1            | Alice       |
| 2            | Bob         |
| 3            | Michael     |
| 4            | Kelly       |

customer_orders
| order\_id | customer\_id |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 100       | 1            |
| 101       | 2            |
| 102       | 1            |


### ðŸ”¹ INNER JOIN
Returns rows where thereâ€™s a match in both tables.
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, first_name, co.order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN customer_orders co
  ON c.customer_id = co.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id, co.order_id;
```

Output:
| customer\_id | first\_name | order\_id |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| 1            | Alice       | 100       |
| 1            | Alice       | 102       |
| 2            | Bob         | 101       |

- Only customers with orders are shown.

### ðŸ”¹ RIGHT JOIN (aka RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all orders, with customer info (if available).
If a customer is missing, their info will be NULL.
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, first_name, co.order_id
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN customer_orders co
  ON c.customer_id = co.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id, co.order_id;
```

Output:
| customer\_id | first\_name | order\_id |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| 1            | Alice       | 100       |
| 1            | Alice       | 102       |
| 2            | Bob         | 101       |
-  In this case, all orders have matching customers, so it's the same as an inner join.

### ðŸ”¹ FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all rows from both tables.
If there's no match, the missing side shows NULL.

MySQL doesnâ€™t support `FULL OUTER JOIN` directly, but you can simulate it using `UNION`:
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, first_name, co.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN customer_orders co
  ON c.customer_id = co.customer_id

UNION

SELECT c.customer_id, first_name, co.order_id
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN customer_orders co
  ON c.customer_id = co.customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id, order_id;
```

Output:
| customer\_id | first\_name | order\_id |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| 1            | Alice       | 100       |
| 1            | Alice       | 102       |
| 2            | Bob         | 101       |
| 3            | Michael     | NULL      |
| 4            | Kelly       | NULL      |
- In this case, since all orders have matching customers and some customers donâ€™t have orders, it looks the same as the LEFT JOIN result. But if there were unmatched orders, they would appear here too.
