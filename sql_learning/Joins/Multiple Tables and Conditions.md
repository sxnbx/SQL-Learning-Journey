# ðŸ”— SQL Joins: Multiple Tables and Conditions

In SQL, a JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column â€” usually a foreign key. This is super useful when data is split across different tables.

For example:
You might have a `customers` table and a `customer_orders table`.
You want to see which customer made which order â€” thatâ€™s where joins come in!
