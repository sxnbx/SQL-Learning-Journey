# 🔗 SQL Join: Self Joins
📌 A self join is when a table is joined to itself. This is useful for comparing rows within the same table or uncovering relationships (like boss–employee hierarchies) that can't be seen with a regular WHERE clause.

## 🔁 Simple Self Join: Matching Rows Based on a Column
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers c
JOIN customers ss
  ON c.first_name = ss.first_name;
```
- Here, we’re joining the `customers` table to itself where the `first_name` matches.
This might help find people with the same name.

## Self Join Example: Boss–Employee Relationship
Let’s say we store employees and their boss relationships all in one customers table.
Assume:
- Customer with ID 101 is the boss of 102
- 102 is the boss of 103
- and so on...

We can simulate this using a self join.

Step 1: Show all rows with the self join
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers c
JOIN customers ss
  ON c.customer_id = ss.customer_id + 1;
```
-This joins each employee with the person whose customer_id is one less, simulating a chain of command.

Step 2: Select key columns — employee and boss info
```sql
SELECT 
  c.customer_id     AS employee_id,
  c.first_name      AS employee_first,
  c.last_name       AS employee_last,
  ss.customer_id    AS boss_id,
  ss.first_name     AS boss_first,
  ss.last_name      AS boss_last
FROM customers c
JOIN customers ss
  ON c.customer_id = ss.customer_id + 1;
```
- This query returns each employee's ID and name along with their boss’s ID and name, by joining the customers table to itself.

## 💬 When to Use a Self Join?
Self joins are used when:
- You want to compare rows in the same table
- You need to model relationships between rows (e.g., manager–employee, product–replacement, etc.)
- A WHERE clause alone can't capture the structure or relationship
