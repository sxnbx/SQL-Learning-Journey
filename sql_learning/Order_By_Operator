# üî¢ SQL `ORDER BY` ‚Äì Sorting Your Results

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **organize query results** by one or more columns in either ascending or descending order.

---

## üß† What is `ORDER BY`?

- **Ascending (`ASC`)** ‚Äì A to Z or smallest to largest (default)
- **Descending (`DESC`)** ‚Äì Z to A or largest to smallest

---

## ‚ú® Examples

### üî° Sort Alphabetically (Ascending)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name;
-- Sorts customers by their first_name from A ‚Üí Z.

###  Sort in Reverse Alphabetical Order
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name DESC;
-- Sorts customers by first_name from Z ‚Üí A.

### Sort by Multiple Columns
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state, total_money_spent DESC;
-- First sorts by state in ascending order.
-- Then sorts total_money_spent in descending order within each state.

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state DESC, total_money_spent DESC;
-- Both state and total_money_spent are sorted in descending order.

### Order by Column Number (Not Best Practice)
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY 8 DESC, 9 ASC;
-- Sorts by the 8th column in descending order and the 9th column in ascending order.
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using column numbers can be risky‚Äîif column positions change, the query may no longer return the intended results.

### Sample Output (Mock Data)
Assume the following customers table:

| customer\_id | first\_name | last\_name | state | total\_money\_spent |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| 1            | Kevin       | Smith      | TX    | 800                 |
| 2            | John        | Snow       | NY    | 500                 |
| 3            | Anakin      | Skywalker  | TX    | 1200                |
| 4            | Luna        | Lovegood   | PA    | 950                 |

### Query:
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state, total_money_spent DESC;

### Output:
| customer\_id | first\_name | last\_name | state | total\_money\_spent |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| 4            | Luna        | Lovegood   | PA    | 950                 |
| 2            | John        | Snow       | NY    | 500                 |
| 3            | Anakin      | Skywalker  | TX    | 1200                |
| 1            | Kevin       | Smith      | TX    | 800                 |
