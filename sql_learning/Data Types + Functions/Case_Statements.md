# SQL: CAST and CONVERT Functions
SQL lets you convert data from one type to another using CAST() and CONVERT(). These are helpful when working with mismatched or inconsistent data typesâ€”especially in reporting, filtering, or joining tables.

## Notes
### `CAST()`
The `CAST()` function changes a value from one data type to another
```sql
CAST(value AS target_data_type)
```

**ðŸ“Œ Example: Convert Text to DateTime**\
```sql
SELECT CAST("2022-01-01" AS DATETIME);
```
- This turns the string `"2022-01-01"` into a `DATETIME` format

**ðŸ“Œ Example: Convert a Column to DateTime**
```sql
SELECT birth_date,
       CAST(birth_date AS DATETIME) AS Casted_Date
FROM customers;
```
- Even if `birth_date` is already in date format, you can cast it to ensure consistency or prepare for operations that require a specific type

### `CONVERT()`
`CONVERT()` works similarly to `CAST()` but uses a slightly different syntax:
```sql
CONVERT(value, target_data_type)
```

**ðŸ“Œ Example: Use CONVERT for the Same Task**
```sql
SELECT birth_date,
       CAST(birth_date AS DATETIME) AS Casted,
       CONVERT(birth_date, DATETIME) AS Converted
FROM customers;
```
-  Both `CAST` and `CONVERT` return the same result, though `CONVERT()` is more commonly used in SQL Server.

## Summary
| Function    | Syntax                 | Description                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `CAST()`    | `CAST(value AS type)`  | Standard SQL conversion method    |
| `CONVERT()` | `CONVERT(value, type)` | SQL Server-specific, same purpose |

## Real-World Applications
- Cleaning data: Convert string dates to DATETIME before filtering or sorting.
- Reporting: Standardize data types in dashboards (ex., Excel/Power BI exports).
- Joins: Match columns of different types before joining tables.
