## SQL: Aliasing

Aliasing lets you change the **name of columns in the query output** without modifying the actual table structure.

### Examples:

```sql
-- Rename columns in the output
SELECT product_name AS 'Goodie Name', units_in_stock AS 'uis'
FROM products;

-- Create a new column by calculating potential revenue and give it an alias
SELECT units_in_stock * sale_price AS Potential_Revenue
FROM products;

-- Use table alias to shorten table name and calculate potential revenue
SELECT p.units_in_stock * p.sale_price AS Potential_Revenue
FROM products p;
