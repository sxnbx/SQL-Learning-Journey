## SQL: LIMIT Clause

The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.

### Examples:

```sql
-- Return any 5 customers who spent more than 10,000 (order is not guaranteed)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE total_money_spent > 10000
LIMIT 5;

-- Return the top 5 customers who spent the most money
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY total_money_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;  -- LIMIT always goes at the end

-- Return 2 customers starting from the 6th row (offset 5)
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY total_money_spent DESC
LIMIT 5, 2;
-- First number: offset (start at row 6, since offset is zero-based)
-- Second number: number of rows to return
