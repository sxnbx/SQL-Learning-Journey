## ‚ú® Examples

### üÖ∞Ô∏è Starts With...

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE 'K%';

Finds names that start with K (like Kevin, Kara, Kelly).
Not case-sensitive in most systems.

### üîö Ends With...
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '%n';
- Finds names that end in n (like John, Megan, Anakin).

### Contains...
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '%n%';
- Finds names that contain n anywhere (like Kevin, Luna, Anakin).

### Exact Position Matching
-- One character before 'n'
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '_n';

-- Two characters before 'n'
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '__n';

-- A pattern with a letter in the middle
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '_o_';

-- Looking for something like "Anakin"
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '___kin';


### Combining % and _
-- Last names starting with 's' and followed by exactly 4 characters (like Smith, Stone)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE 's____%';

-- Phone numbers that start with '975-'
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE phone LIKE '975-%';

### Sample Output (Mock Data)
Let‚Äôs say our customers table has:

| customer\_id | first\_name | last\_name | phone        |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1            | Kevin       | Smith      | 975-555-1234 |

| 3            | Anakin      | Skywalker  | 975-999-0000 |
| 4            | John        | Snow       | 703-456-7890 |
| 5            | Frodo       | Baggins    | 312-321-5432 |

Query:
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE '%n';

Result:
| customer\_id | first\_name | last\_name | phone        |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1            | Kevin       | Smith      | 975-555-1234 |
