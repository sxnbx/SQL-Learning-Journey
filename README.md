# ðŸŒ± SQL Learning Journey with MySQL

Hi, I'm Anna, and welcome to my MySQL SQL Learning Journey! This repository is where I document my progress as I build my foundation in SQL. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on SQL essentials, I hope you find these resources helpful.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you'll find exercise scripts, notes, and examples covering key SQL concepts including:
- **[SELECT Statements](sql_learning/select_statements.sql):** How to retrieve data from tables.
- **[WHERE Clause](sql_learning/WHERE_clause):** Filtering records based on specific conditions.
- **[Comparison Operators](sql_learning/comparison_operators):** Using operators such as:
  - `=` (Equals)
  - `<>` (Not equal)
  - `<` (Less than)
  - `>` (Greater than)
  - `!<` (Not less than) *(if applicable)*
  - `!>` (Not greater than) *(if applicable)*
  - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
  - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- **[Logical Operations](sql_learning/logical_operators):** Implementing `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` in your queries.
- **IN Operator**: Checking if a value matches any value in a list.

## Tools and Practices
